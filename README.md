# Sorting-App
Sorts elements in a text files into a list organized in ascending order by length of the name, then alphabetically. 

Need python to run the Sorting App. You can use any linux distribution you like but I used the windows subsystem for linux.

Once you load the files into the linux distro you should be able to find the files then run the command 
"python3 SortFunction.py" and it should work. You might have to install python for it so run by running the command "sudo apt install python3 python3-pi" if you do not already have it.
